# Avispa ECM

Small framework for implementing ECM (Enterprise Content Management) solution.

### Antlr4 support

By default, Antlr4 grammar files (`.g4`) should be located in `/src/main/antlr4` 
folder. In order to properly use generated files, this folder has to be marked as
`Sources Root`. You can double check if everything is correct by opening `Module Settings` and checking
the paths for `Source Folders`.
